- the goals behind the NaLaQ project:
  - be the last software to be programmed by programming language coding
  - a software that can do everything that current wide-spread existing technology is capable
  - communicate verbally with the computer to tell it what we want
  - easily automate computer tasks without needing a computer expert to intervene
  - free the people from greedy and prying technology vendors
- the NaLaQ system tries to use well known data standards to achieve universal semantics:
  - the main standards are URI, HTTP, HTML, JSON and SQL
  - secondary standards like CSV, YAML, RDF, image, audio and video file formats are mapped to one of the 5 main standards
  - the same applies for file, ftp, data, mailto, geo and jdbc uri schemes
  - the system also uses the non-standard nalaq URI scheme and text/x-nalaq file format to embed NaLaQ code into a URI or in a file
  - the system will also use NaLaQ and ETS as uri scheme or file format to access all the universal semantics created by the system
- the type system in type.kt file:
  - the Type interface manages all data types, properties and instances
    - possible schema sources include JVM classes, SQL tables, RDF types, JSON schema and data files
    - automated schema extraction by scanning data in Collection<Map> format from the following data types:
      - CSV, JSON, YAML and HTML tables
  - The Property class manages type properties
  - the PropertyValue class manages reference to an instance property value (equivalent to RDF Statement class)
  - the 8 data levels are defined in the createRootTypes function
  - builtin subtypes are defined in the createSubTypes function
  - custom types created programmatically, by importing schema source or scanning Collection<Map|String|Property|Map.Entry> data structures
    - if collection items type is string, each string must be a valid SQL column definition
    - if collection items type is map, all items must must have the same keys and the same value type (or null) for each key
  - public management functions:
        fun getTypeByClass(klass: KClass<*>): Type
        fun getTypeByName(name: String): Type?
        fun getTypeFromData(data: Collection<*>, name: String? = null): Type?
- the URI system implemented in uri.kt file:
  - schemes: http,https,file,data,geo,nalaq,jdbc,sftp,mailto,sip
  - methods implemented as extension functions: get, post, put, delete
  - custom uri schemes can be created with namespace management
- mimetype management in format.kt file:
  - automated encoding and decoding of supported mimetypes with class Format
  - direct InputStream reading and OutputStream writing for Table could also be named Entity or TypeDefinition or Definition or Schema and have a generic map/entity schema usagemore efficiency
  - Format class has utility functions decodeText and encodeText to use strings instead of streams
  - public management functions:
        fun getFormat(txt: String): Format?
        fun getExtensionMimetype(txt: String): String?
        fun getMimetypeExtensions(txt: String): List<String>
  - builtin support for all image formats supported by the JVM
  - other builtin formats defined in the function initManagedMimetypes:
        application/octet-stream text/plain text/x-java-properties text/csv
        text/uri-list text/x-nalaq application/json application/yaml text/html
        application/xml application/x-www-form-urlencoded
- namespace management system in namespace.kt file:
  - can be used as a word dictionary for natural languages, script constants/variables and RDF namespaces
  - the registered prefix allows words in the namespace to be used as uris in the NaLaQ system
  - public management functions:
        fun getNamespace(prefix: String): Namespace? 
        fun addNamespace(ns: Namespace): Boolean
- databases management in database.kt file:
  - create an instance with a jdbc uri loaded with java.net.URI("jdbc:<vendor>://...").get()
  - user and password can be supplied in the uri user info part 
  - supported vendors: h2, mysql, postgresql, sqlite, derby, mssql, msaccess, oracle, mongodb
  - can be used as a namespace where keys can be table names, column names and specified instance string values
- data conversion system in converters.kt file:
  - generic conversion function: fun <T: Any> convert(value: Any?, type: KClass<T>): T
  - specific class conversion functions:
        toString toCharSequence toByteArray toChar
        toByte toShort toInt toLong toFloat toDouble toNumber toBoolean
        toMap toList toSet toCollection toArray
        toView toDateTime toDate toTime
        toFunction toClass toType toProperty
        toNamespace toURI toExpression
- special media types classes in view.kt file:
  - View interface with source URI and ETS value
  - View implementations: Chemical, GeoLocation, Document, Image, Audio, Video, Model
  - public generic function: fun createView(uri: URI): View
- language functions in function.kt:
  - builtin natural language concepts: and as do done each equal from get in is less more not of or to while with
  - KFunction extension for user function creation: class NaLaQFunction(...): KFunction<Any?>
  - function extension for text parsing purposes: KFunction<*>.precedence(function: KFunction<*>): Int
- text parser implemented in parser.kt file:
  - converts text to expression that can be evaluated to execute underlying kotlin functions or java methods
  - recognizes following token types: defined names, numbers, date and time, uris, JVM qualified objects and quoted strings
  - names are defined with configured namespaces
  - default namespace defines builtin functions, registered types and keywords (all, true, false, null)
  - contextual variables for user thread or custom function internal is managed by the ThreadLocal Context class
    - uses getContext and findContext public functions for context management
- HTTP server implemented with ktor in server.kt file:
  - dynamic routing configured by the Configuration class passed in command line arguments
  - server port, namespaces, web folder and apis endpoints can be configured
  - if an api endpoint resolves to a function, a POST or PUT query can execute it with the request body as parameters of the function
